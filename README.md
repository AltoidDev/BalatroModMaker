Entirely nonfunctional FOR NOW. It might take a long time for me to figure out how to generate code.

Assistance would be appreciated, espicially if you have experience with modding balatro or generated code.

A modding tool for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com), attempting to make modding more accesable, similar to MCreator for Minecraft.
