Mods will require [steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), and I will try to update it to use the same version as [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid).

------------------------------------------

Entirely nonfunctional FOR NOW. It might take a long time for me to figure out how to generate code.

Assistance would be appreciated, espicially if you have experience with modding balatro or generated code.

------------------------------------------

A modding tool for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com), attempting to make modding more accesable, similar to MCreator for Minecraft.
